               <h2>Facts about Dogs</h2> 
               <p>Dogs were the first animals domesticated by humans.
            Dogs are the most diverse mammals on earth.
            Dogs’ eyes are designed to see in the dark.
            About 28,000 dogs compete at the world’s largest dog show every year.
            Dogs can sniff which way you’re walking in five steps.</p>

                8. Dogs’ noses can sense heat and thermal radiation, which explains why blind or deaf dogs can still hunt.
                
                9. The French Bulldog was first named the most popular breed in 2022.

                11. Yawning is contagious — even for dogs. Research shows that the sound of a human yawn can trigger one from your dog.
                And it’s four times as likely to happen when it’s the yawn of a person your pet knows.
                
                12. The Dandie Dinmont Terrier is the only breed named for a fictional person, a character in the novel “Guy Mannering”
                by Sir Walter Scott.
                
                13. Dogs curl up in a ball when sleeping to protect their organs — a holdover from their days in the wild, when they
                were vulnerable to predator attacks.</p>
